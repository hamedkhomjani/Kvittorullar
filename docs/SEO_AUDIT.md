### A) Meta Tags & Titles

    *   Example: `<title>NordicRoll - Premium Receipt Rolls</title>`
*   **Meta Descriptions**: Meta descriptions exist for all pages and are engagingly written, which increases Click-Through Rate (CTR).
*   **Canonical Tags**: Canonical tags are correctly present on all pages, preventing Duplicate Content.
*   **Hreflang Tags**: Language-related tags (`en`, `sv`) are correctly implemented, which is great for international SEO.

### B) Content Structure

*   **Heading Hierarchy**: The order of `<h2>` and `<h3>` tags is logical and helps Google understand the page structure.

*   **Robots.txt**: Google bot access is open and linked to the sitemap.
*   **JSON-LD (Structured Data)**: `Organization` and `Product` schemas are used on the home page, increasing the chance of displaying stars and prices in Google results.

Although the site is in good condition, the following can further improve your ranking:

### 1. Schema (Structured Data) for all pages
*   Currently, only the home page has complete schema.

### 2. Performance
*   **Lazy Loading**: For images at the bottom of the page (like reviews or footer), you can use the `loading="lazy"` attribute to increase initial load speed. (It's already on some product images; ensure it's applied to all non-essential images).

### 3. Internal Linking
*   Ensure that you link to Product Pages with relevant keywords from within blog posts (if added in the future) or different sections.
